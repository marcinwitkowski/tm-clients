  """Service that implements Techmo Text-To-Speech (TTS) API.

  Service's `Synthesize` method accepts `SynthesizeRequest` object which contains whole phrase to be synthesized.  
  You have to put the phrase as a string in `text` field of `SynthesizeRequest`. The string has to be in orthographic form. In that string you can use several special tags which can be interpreted. Tags have to be in from `<tag>something special</tag>` and can occur in any place in text. Currently interpreted tags are:

  | Tag | Description | Example (input) | Example (output) |
  | --- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
  | **cardinal** | *cardinal number* | `<cardinal>7</cardinal>` | *siedem* |
  | **signed** | *number with sign* | `<signed>-15</signed>` | *minus piętnaście* |
  | **ordinal** | *ordinal number* | `<ordinal>1</ordinal>` | *pierwszy* |
  | **fraction** | *fractional number* | `<fraction>3/4</fraction>` | *trzy czwarte* |
  | **postal** | *postal code* | `<postal>30-020</postal>` | *trzydzieści zero dwadzieścia* |
  | **time** | *time* | `<time>22:00</time>` | *dwudziesta druga* |
  | **date** | *date* | `<date>12/05/2001</date>` | *dwunasty maja dwa tysiące jeden* |

  Note: when interpreting tags only nominal case is supported at the moment.

  You can set `SynthesizeConfig`'s fields to specify parameters of synthesis. Currently supported option is only `sample_rate_hertz`, which is desired sampling frequency (in hertz) of synthesized audio.

  `SynthesizeRequest` can be sent to the service via gRPC insecure channel (that does not require authentication).

  `Synthesize` returns synthesized audio in `SynthesizeResponse` as a stream. When reading from the stream you have to check if `SynthesizeResponse` contains `error` field. If it does you can print its `code` and `description`. No `error` field in `SynthesizeResponse` means everything worked fine and its `audio` contains byte `content` that can be appended to received audio samples with `sample_rate_hertz` sampling frequency in hertz. When receiving `SynthesizeResponse` with `audio` you have to check if its `end_of_stream` flag is set to true. When it is set to true it means service has fnished synthesis and you can save your wave file with received synthesized audio content.
